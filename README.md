# The Slinger's Quest: Rise of the Slimes

The basic idea and structure of our code came from the examples from [three.js](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=game#games_fps).

After a lot of modification, the origin code looks very different. The outline of it can be currently viewed in control.js, stone.js and player.js.

We have also recieved a lot of help from Zhou Liangguang's group while implementing loadAssets.js. Hereby we thank their contribution.

The background image of our game is generated from ChatGPT and the music is generated by [udio](https://www.udio.com/). We are still using the world map from three.js, and other meshes(including character, stones, slimes) are downloaded from [poly.pizza](https://poly.pizza/). The slime dying sound is downloaded from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6p1YTUN74).

We have also recieved help from Xu Guowei, who took this course last year, while uploading our game online. You can currently view it at [https://acg-project.github.io/](https://acg-project.github.io/). Running our demo locally is also very easy. You only have to install three.js and run    `npx vite` in this folder.
